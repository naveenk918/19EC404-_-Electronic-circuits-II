### **Result**

Thus the voltage shunt feedback amplifier is designed and constructed  and the following parameters are calculated.
| S.No | Parameters | Without Feedback | With Feedback |
|:----:|-------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Lower cut-off frequency |f1= 0.45KHz |f1 =0.3KHz|
| 2 | Upper cut-off frequency | f2= 500KHz| F2=1.5MHz |
| 3 | Bandwidth |  BW = 499.55KHz |  BW = 1499.63KHz|
| 4 | Mid-band Gain | Avmid= 25.52 | Avmid = 19.40 |
| 5 | Gain at half power point | G0 = 18.04 | G0 = 13.71 |

---

**Conclusion:**  
The frequency response of the voltage-shunt feedback amplifier was studied. It was observed that the **gain decreases** while the **bandwidth increases** when negative feedback is applied, confirming the theoretical expectations.
