### **Result**

Thus the current series  feedback amplifier is designed and constructed  and the following parameters are calculated.
| S.No | Parameters | Without Feedback | With Feedback |
|:----:|-------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Lower cut-off frequency |f1 =0.6KHz | f1=0.45KHz |
| 2 | Upper cut-off frequency | f2=300KHz | f2=400KHz |
| 3 | Bandwidth | BW = 299.4KHz | BW = 399.55KHz |
| 4 | Mid-band Gain |Avmid = 12.8 |Avmid = 8.40  |
| 5 | Gain at half power point | G0 = 9.40 |  G0 = 5.93|

---

**Conclusion:**  
The frequency response of the current series feedback amplifier was studied. It was observed that the **gain decreases** while the **bandwidth increases** when negative feedback is applied, confirming the theoretical expectations.
