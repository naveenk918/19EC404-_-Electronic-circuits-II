### **Result**

Thus the current shunt feedback amplifier is designed and constructed  and the following parameters are calculated.
| S.No | Parameters | Without Feedback | With Feedback |
|:----:|-------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Lower cut-off frequency | f1= 0.4KHz| f1 = 0.5KHz |
| 2 | Upper cut-off frequency | f2 = 140Khz | f2 = 520 KHz |
| 3 | Bandwidth | BW = 139.6KHz| BW = 519.5KHz|
| 4 | Mid-band Gain | Avmid = 7.36 | Avmid = 3.21 |
| 5 | Gain at half power point | G0 = 4.71 | G0 = 2.1 |

---

**Conclusion:**  
The frequency response of the current shunt feedback amplifier was studied. It was observed that the **gain decreases** while the **bandwidth increases** when negative feedback is applied, confirming the theoretical expectations.
