## **Result**
Thus, the **voltage series feedback amplifier** is designed and constructed.  
The following parameters are calculated:

| S.No | Parameters | Without Feedback | With Feedback |
|:----:|-------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Lower cut-off frequency |f1 =0.28KHz | f1" =0.24KHz |
| 2 | Upper cut-off frequency | f2=1.4MHz | f2 =2.7MHz |
| 3 | Bandwidth | \( BW = fh - fl = 1.39MHz) | \( BW = f'h - f'l = 26MHz) |
| 4 | Mid-band Gain | \( A{v(mid)} = 21) | \( A'{v(mid)} = 17.04) |
| 5 | Gain at half power point |G0 = 14.8 |G0 =12.08  |
---
**Conclusion:**  
The frequency response of the voltage-series feedback amplifier was studied. It was observed that the **gain decreases** while the **bandwidth increases** when negative feedback is applied, confirming the theoretical expectations.
